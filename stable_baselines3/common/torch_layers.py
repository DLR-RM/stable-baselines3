    Get the actor and critic network architectures for off-policy actor-critic algorithms (SAC, TD3, DDPG).

    The ``net_arch`` parameter allows to specify the amount and size of the hidden layers,
    which can be different for the actor and the critic.
    It is assumed to be a list of ints or a dict.

    1. If it is a list, actor and critic networks will have the same architecture.
        The architecture is represented by a list of integers (of arbitrary length (zero allowed))
        each specifying the number of units per layer.
       If the number of ints is zero, the network will be linear.
    2. If it is a dict,  it should have the following structure:
       ``dict(qf=[<critic network architecture>], pi=[<actor network architecture>])``.
       where the network architecture is a list as described in 1.

    For example, to have actor and critic that share the same network architecture,
    you only need to specify ``net_arch=[256, 256]`` (here, two hidden layers of 256 units each).

    If you want a different architecture for the actor and the critic,
    then you can specify ``net_arch=dict(qf=[400, 300], pi=[64, 64])``.

        Compared to their on-policy counterparts, no shared layers (other than the features extractor)
