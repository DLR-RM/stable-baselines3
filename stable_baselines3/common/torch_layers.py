    1. An arbitrary length (zero allowed) number of integers each specifying the number of units in a shared layer.

    2. An optional dict, to specify the following non-shared layers for the value network and the policy network.

       If it is missing any of the keys (pi or vf), no non-shared layers (empty list) is assumed.

    For example to construct a network with one shared layer of size 55 followed by two non-shared layers for the value
    network of size 255 and a single non-shared layer of size 128 for the policy network, the following layers_spec
    would be used: ``[55, dict(vf=[255, 255], pi=[128])]``. A simple shared network topology with two layers of size 128
    would be specified as [128, 128].

    Get the actor and critic network architectures for off-policy actor-critic algorithms (SAC, TD3, DDPG).

    The ``net_arch`` parameter allows to specify the amount and size of the hidden layers,

    It is assumed to be a list of ints or a dict.

    1. If it is a list, actor and critic networks will have the same architecture.
        The architecture is represented by a list of integers (of arbitrary length (zero allowed))
        each specifying the number of units per layer.
       If the number of ints is zero, the network will be linear.
    2. If it is a dict,  it should have the following structure:
       ``dict(qf=[<critic network architecture>], pi=[<actor network architecture>])``.
       where the network architecture is a list as described in 1.

    For example, to have actor and critic that share the same network architecture,
    you only need to specify ``net_arch=[256, 256]`` (here, two hidden layers of 256 units each).

    If you want a different architecture for the actor and the critic,
