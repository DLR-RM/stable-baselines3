Projects
=========

This is a list of projects using stable-baselines3.
Please tell us, if you want your project to appear on this page ;)


RL Reach
--------

A platform for running reproducible reinforcement learning experiments for customisable robotic reaching tasks. This self-contained and straightforward toolbox allows its users to quickly investigate and identify optimal training configurations.

| Authors: Pierre Aumjaud, David McAuliffe, Francisco Javier Rodr√≠guez Lera, Philip Cardiff
| Github: https://github.com/PierreExeter/rl_reach
| Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04916


Generalized State Dependent Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Robotics
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An exploration method to train RL agent directly on real robots.
It was the starting point of Stable-Baselines3.

| Author: Antonin Raffin, Freek Stulp
| Github: https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/tree/sde
| Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05719

Reacher
-------
A solution to the second project of the Udacity deep reinforcement learning course.
It is an example of:

- wrapping single and multi-agent Unity environments to make them usable in Stable-Baselines3
- creating experimentation scripts which train and run A2C, PPO, TD3 and SAC models (a better choice for this one is https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo)
- generating several pre-trained models which solve the reacher environment

SUMO-RL
-------
A simple interface to instantiate RL environments with SUMO for Traffic Signal Control.

- Supports Multiagent RL
- Compatibility with gym.Env and popular RL libraries such as stable-baselines3 and RLlib
- Easy customisation: state and reward definitions are easily modifiable

| Author: Lucas Alegre
| Github: https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl

gym-pybullet-drones
-------------------
PyBullet Gym environments for single and multi-agent reinforcement learning of quadcopter control.

- Physics-based simulation for the development and test of quadcopter control.
- Compatibility with ``gym.Env``, RLlib's MultiAgentEnv.
- Learning and testing script templates for stable-baselines3 and RLlib.

| Author: Jacopo Panerati
| Github: https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones/
| Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02142

SuperSuit
---------

SuperSuit contains easy to use wrappers for Gym (and multi-agent PettingZoo) environments to do all forms of common preprocessing (frame stacking, converting graphical observations to greyscale, max-and-skip for Atari, etc.). It also notably includes:

-Wrappers that apply lambda functions to observations, actions, or rewards with a single line of code.
-All wrappers can be used natively on vector environments, wrappers exist to Gym environments to vectorized environments and concatenate multiple vector environments together
-A wrapper is included that allows for using regular single agent RL libraries (e.g. stable baselines) to learn simple multi-agent PettingZoo environments, explained in this tutorial:
