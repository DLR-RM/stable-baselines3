Imitation Learning
==================

The `imitation <https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation>`__ library implements
imitation learning algorithms on top of Stable-Baselines3, including:

  - Behavioral Cloning
  - `DAgger <https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0686>`_ with synthetic examples
  - `Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248>`_ (AIRL)
  - `Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476>`_  (GAIL)
  - `Deep RL from Human Preferences <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741>`_ (DRLHP)

You can install imitation with ``pip install imitation``. The `imitation
documentation <https://imitation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ has more details
on how to use the library, including `a quick start guide
<https://imitation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/first-steps.html>`_
for the impatient.
