# Stable Baselines3

Stable Baselines3 (SB3) is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch. It is the next major version of [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines).

You can read a detailed presentation of Stable Baselines3 in the [v1.0 blog post](https://araffin.github.io/post/sb3/) or our [JMLR paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume22/20-1364/20-1364.pdf).


These algorithms will make it easier for the research community and industry to replicate, refine, and identify new ideas, and will create good baselines to build projects on top of. We expect these tools will be used as a base around which new ideas can be added, and as a tool for comparing a new approach against existing ones. We also hope that the simplicity of these tools will allow beginners to experiment with a more advanced toolset, without being buried in implementation details.

**Note: Despite its simplicity of use, Stable Baselines3 (SB3) assumes you have some knowledge about Reinforcement Learning (RL).** You should not utilize this library without some practice. To that extent, we provide good resources in the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/rl.html) to get started with RL.

## Main Features

**The performance of each algorithm was tested** (see *Results* section in their respective page),
you can take a look at the issues [#48](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/48) and [#49](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/49) for more details.

### Planned features

Please take a look at the [Roadmap](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/1) and [Milestones](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/milestones).

## Migration guide: from Stable-Baselines (SB2) to Stable-Baselines3 (SB3)

A migration guide from SB2 to SB3 can be found in the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/migration.html).

## Documentation

Documentation is available online: [https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/)

## Integrations

Stable-Baselines3 has some integration with other libraries/services like Weights & Biases for experiment tracking or Hugging Face for storing/sharing trained models. You can find out more in the [dedicated section](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/integrations.html) of the documentation.


## RL Baselines3 Zoo: A Training Framework for Stable Baselines3 Reinforcement Learning Agents

[RL Baselines3 Zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo) is a training framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL).

It provides scripts for training, evaluating agents, tuning hyperparameters, plotting results and recording videos.

In addition, it includes a collection of tuned hyperparameters for common environments and RL algorithms, and agents trained with those settings.

Goals of this repository:

1. Provide a simple interface to train and enjoy RL agents
2. Benchmark the different Reinforcement Learning algorithms
3. Provide tuned hyperparameters for each environment and RL algorithm
4. Have fun with the trained agents!

Github repo: https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo

Documentation: https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/rl_zoo.html

## SB3-Contrib: Experimental RL Features

We implement experimental features in a separate contrib repository: [SB3-Contrib](https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib)

This allows SB3 to maintain a stable and compact core, while still providing the latest features, like Recurrent PPO (PPO LSTM), Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), Quantile Regression DQN (QR-DQN) or PPO with invalid action masking (Maskable PPO).

Documentation is available online: [https://sb3-contrib.readthedocs.io/](https://sb3-contrib.readthedocs.io/)


## Installation

**Note:** Stable-Baselines3 supports PyTorch >= 1.11

### Prerequisites
Stable Baselines3 requires Python 3.7+.

#### Windows 10

To install stable-baselines on Windows, please look at the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html#prerequisites).


### Install using pip
Install the Stable Baselines3 package:
```
pip install stable-baselines3[extra]
```
**Note:** Some shells such as Zsh require quotation marks around brackets, i.e. `pip install 'stable-baselines3[extra]'` ([More Info](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30539963)).

This includes an optional dependencies like Tensorboard, OpenCV or `atari-py` to train on atari games. If you do not need those, you can use:
```sh
pip install stable-baselines3
```

Please read the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/) for more details and alternatives (from source, using docker).


## Example

Most of the code in the library tries to follow a sklearn-like syntax for the Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

Here is a quick example of how to train and run PPO on a cartpole environment:
```python
import gym

from stable_baselines3 import PPO

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")

model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10_000)

vec_env = model.get_env()
obs = vec_env.reset()
for i in range(1000):
    action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
    obs, reward, done, info = vec_env.step(action)
    vec_env.render()
    # VecEnv resets automatically
    # if done:
    #   obs = env.reset()

env.close()
```

Or just train a model with a one liner if [the environment is registered in Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/gymnasium_basics/environment_creation/#registering-envs) and if [the policy is registered](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/custom_policy.html):

```python
from stable_baselines3 import PPO

model = PPO("MlpPolicy", "CartPole-v1").learn(10_000)
```

Please read the [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/) for more examples.

 * `Box`: A N-dimensional box that containes every point in the action space.
 * `Discrete`: A list of possible actions, where each timestep only one of the actions can be used.
 * `MultiDiscrete`: A list of possible actions, where each timestep only one action of each discrete set can be used.
 * `MultiBinary`: A list of possible actions, where each timestep any of the actions can be used in any combination.
