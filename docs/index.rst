Welcome to Stable Baselines3 docs! - RL Baselines Made Easy
===========================================================

`Stable Baselines3 <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3>`_ is a set of improved implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch.
It is the next major version of `Stable Baselines <https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines>`_.


Github repository: https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3

RL Baselines3 Zoo (collection of pre-trained agents): https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo

RL Baselines3 Zoo also offers a simple interface to train, evaluate agents and do hyperparameter tuning.


Main Features
--------------

- Unified structure for all algorithms
- PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
- Documented functions and classes
- Tests, high code coverage and type hints
- Clean code
- Tensorboard support
