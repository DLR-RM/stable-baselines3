Projects
=========

This is a list of projects using stable-baselines3.
Please tell us, if you want your project to appear on this page ;)

DriverGym
---------

An open-source Gym-compatible environment specifically tailored for developing RL algorithms for autonomous driving. DriverGym provides access to more than 1000 hours of expert logged data and also supports reactive and data-driven agent behavior. The performance of an RL policy can be easily validated using an extensive and flexible closed-loop evaluation protocol. We also provide behavior cloning baselines using supervised learning and RL, trained in DriverGym.

SuperSuit
---------

SuperSuit contains easy to use wrappers for Gym (and multi-agent PettingZoo) environments to do all forms of common preprocessing (frame stacking, converting graphical observations to greyscale, max-and-skip for Atari, etc.). It also notably includes:

-Wrappers that apply lambda functions to observations, actions, or rewards with a single line of code.
-All wrappers can be used natively on vector environments, wrappers exist to Gym environments to vectorized environments and concatenate multiple vector environments together
-A wrapper is included that allows for using regular single agent RL libraries (e.g. stable baselines) to learn simple multi-agent PettingZoo environments, explained in this tutorial:

gym-electric-motor
-------------------

An OpenAI gym environment for the simulation and control of electric drive trains.
Think of Matlab/Simulink for electric motors, inverters, and load profiles, but non-graphical and open-source in Python.

`gym-electric-motor` offers a rich interface for customization, including
- plug-and-play of different control algorithms ranging from classical controllers (like field-oriented control) up to any RL agent you can find,
- reward shaping,
- load profiling,
- finite-set or continuous-set control,
- one-phase and three-phase motors such as induction machines and permanent magnet synchronous motors, among others.

SB3 is used as an example in one of many tutorials showcasing the easy usage of `gym-electric-motor`.
