^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Added ``StopTrainingOnNoModelImprovement`` to callback collection (@caburu)

Bug Fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed a bug in ``VecMonitor``. The monitor did not consider the ``info_keywords`` during stepping (@ScheiklP)

  with very long keys.)

Release 1.4.0 (2022-01-18)
---------------------------

*TRPO, ARS and multi env training for off-policy algorithms*

Breaking Changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Dropped python 3.6 support (as announced in previous release)
- Renamed ``mask`` argument of the ``predict()`` method to ``episode_start`` (used with RNN policies only)
- local variables ``action``, ``done`` and ``reward`` were renamed to their plural form for offpolicy algorithms (``actions``, ``dones``, ``rewards``),
  this may affect custom callbacks.
- Removed ``episode_reward`` field from ``RolloutReturn()`` type


.. warning::

    An update to the ``HER`` algorithm is planned to support multi-env training and remove the max episode length constrain.
    (see `PR #704 <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/pull/704>`_)
    This will be a backward incompatible change (model trained with previous version of ``HER`` won't work with the new version).



New Features:

- Added ``copy()`` and ``combine()`` methods to ``RunningMeanStd``

- Added Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) (@cyprienc)
- Added Augmented Random Search (ARS) (@sgillen)

Bug Fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^
- Fixed a bug where ``set_env()`` with ``VecNormalize`` would result in an error with off-policy algorithms (thanks @cleversonahum)
- FPS calculation is now performed based on number of steps performed during last ``learn`` call, even when ``reset_num_timesteps`` is set to ``False`` (@kachayev)
- Fixed evaluation script for recurrent policies (experimental feature in SB3 contrib)
- Fixed a bug where the observation would be incorrectly detected as non-vectorized instead of throwing an error
- The env checker now properly checks and warns about potential issues for continuous action spaces when the boundaries are too small or when the dtype is not float32

Pre-Release 0.11.0 (2021-02-27)

  this allows to return the unnormalized reward in the case of Atari games for instance.
- Renamed ``common.vec_env.is_wrapped`` to ``common.vec_env.is_vecenv_wrapped`` to avoid confusion
  with the new ``is_wrapped()`` helper
- Renamed ``_get_data()`` to ``_get_constructor_parameters()`` for policies (this affects independent saving/loading of policies)
- Removed ``n_episodes_rollout`` and merged it with ``train_freq``, which now accepts a tuple ``(frequency, unit)``:
- ``replay_buffer`` in ``collect_rollout`` is no more optional

.. code-block:: python

  # model = SAC("MlpPolicy", env, n_episodes_rollout=1, train_freq=-1)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Add support for ``VecFrameStack`` to stack on first or last observation dimension, along with

  which otherwise causes downstream breaking errors in training (@decodyng)

Pre-Release 0.10.0 (2020-10-28)
-------------------------------

**HER with online and offline sampling, bug fixes for features extraction**

Breaking Changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **Warning:** Renamed ``common.cmd_util`` to ``common.env_util`` for clarity (affects ``make_vec_env`` and ``make_atari_env`` functions)

- Added Hindsight Experience Replay ``HER``. (@megan-klaiber)
- ``VecNormalize`` now supports ``gym.spaces.Dict`` observation spaces
- Support logging videos to Tensorboard (@SwamyDev)

Bug Fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^
- Fix GAE computation for on-policy algorithms (off-by one for the last value) (thanks @Wovchena)
- Fixed potential issue when loading a different environment
