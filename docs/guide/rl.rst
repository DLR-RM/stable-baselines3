Reinforcement Learning Resources
================================


Stable-Baselines3 assumes that you already understand the basic concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

However, if you want to learn about RL, there are several good resources to get started:

- `OpenAI Spinning Up <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`_
- `The Deep Reinforcement Learning Course <https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction>`_
- `David Silver's course <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html>`_
- `Lilian Weng's blog <https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html>`_
- `Berkeley's Deep RL Bootcamp <https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures>`_
- `Berkeley's Deep Reinforcement Learning course <http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/>`_
- `DQN tutorial <https://github.com/araffin/rlss23-dqn-tutorial>`_
