Stable-Baselines3 Docs - Reliable Reinforcement Learning Implementations
========================================================================

`Stable Baselines3 (SB3) <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3>`_ is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch.
It is the next major version of `Stable Baselines <https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines>`_.


Github repository: https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3

Paper: https://jmlr.org/papers/volume22/20-1364/20-1364.pdf

RL Baselines3 Zoo (training framework for SB3): https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo

RL Baselines3 Zoo provides a collection of pre-trained agents, scripts for training, evaluating agents, tuning hyperparameters, plotting results and recording videos.

SB3 Contrib (experimental RL code, latest algorithms): https://github.com/Stable-Baselines-Team/stable-baselines3-contrib


Main Features
--------------

- Unified structure for all algorithms
- PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
- Documented functions and classes
- Tests, high code coverage and type hints
- Clean code
- Tensorboard support
- **The performance of each algorithm was tested** (see *Results* section in their respective page)
